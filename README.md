# Developers Notes
If you develop an application, or driver for DOS 64, I, the developer, request that you file a issue on the issue tracker as "enhancement" with a link to the github repository. Assuming it is complient with the OS's quailty standards, I shall potentially add it to the configuration script for building the OS as additonal software.
